I want to display the no.of people registered for the event organised by an organizer and i also want
to display the events registered by a participant so to achieve this i want to know who is organizer
and who is participant so for this in the signup itself i want to take the input from the user using
radio button and i have a concept of user_groups in the django db in which i can have different
types of users so i can seperate them into groups so for this i though to create them according to the
radio button i want to seperate them and save into groups but here comes a concept called signals

signals can be used to do the operations whenever a req is received.... but to work with signals it 
only works with instance that is instance of User so the fields in the instance can only be used 
so for that iam creating a role field in the user table using the model check the model's class for role creation i need to extend the user also look into settings AUTH_USER_MODEL
